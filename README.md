# Authentication Service Documentation

## Introduction

The Authentication Service comprises both backend and frontend components, allowing users to register, verify accounts, and log in to obtain a JWT token for authentication.

## Backend

The backend is built using Express.js, a Node.js web application framework, and TypeScript. It provides RESTful APIs for user registration and login. User data is stored securely using bcrypt for password hashing and JWT for token-based authentication.

### Endpoints

- `POST /register`: Register a new user account.
- `POST /login`: Log in to obtain a JWT token.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a seamless user experience for registration and login processes.

### Components

- **Registration Form**: Allows users to register by providing a username and password.
- **Login Form**: Allows users to log in with their credentials.

## Deployment

The Authentication Service can be deployed to any cloud platform. Docker containers can be used for packaging and deploying both backend and frontend components separately.

## Conclusion

The Authentication Service provides a secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism for applications. Developers can easily understand, test, and deploy the service using the guidelines provided in this documentation.
